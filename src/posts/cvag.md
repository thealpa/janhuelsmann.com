![App Promo Mockup](/img/cvag_mockup.webp){.full-width-img}

CVAG Departure Monitor is a minimal iPhone App displaying [CVAG](https://www.cvag.de/){.highlight} departure times to help you navigate the Chemnitz area. The same data can be accessed using CVAG's [Echtzeitauskunft](https://www.cvag.de/de/Fahrplan/Echtzeitauskunft_5779.html){.highlight}.

The app was build entirely using ✨ **SwiftUI** ✨ as I tried to learn the basics of Swift and SwiftUI.

The app can be downloaded from the [App Store](#){.highlight} and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/thealpa/CVAG){.highlight}. If you like the app, please consider leaving a positive App Store rating or star it on GitHub.
